    <p>Today I am going to teach you how to make authentic lasagna as if it were an Italian nonna from the

    <h4 class="sub-section-title">Sauce</h4>
    <ol class="directions">
        <li>Cut the pancetta into small squares.But first we remove the skin because it is very hard.</li>
        <li>We put the bacon over medium heat so that it is done slowly.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cut the vegetables into small squares.</li>
        <li>Don't forget to stir the bacon!</li>
        <li>Add a splash of oil to the pan with the bacon,possible olive.</li>
        <li> We add the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Add 1 pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>And, over medium low heat, we cook until the onion, the carrot and celery soften.</li>
        <li>We add the beef.</li>
        <li>We make medium high heat and stir very well.</li>
        <li>Once the meat has changed color, add 1 glass of Red wine.</li>
        <li>Cook until the alcohol evaporates.</li>
        <li>Add tomato saucechopped tomatoes. I will use whole canned tomatoes but you can
            Use the tomato sauce that you like the most.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce has started to boil we make the fire lower and put the lid but
            leaving a hole for it to come out the steam</li>
        <li>The sauce must be cooked for 2 to 4 hours. Very calmly. If you see that 
            it is getting dry add a little more waterof broth</li>
        <li> It took me 3 hours to cook the sauce.</li>
        <li>Season it to your liking.</li>
        <li>Add the milk to balance the acidity.</li>
        <li>The sauce is ready.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="sub-section-title">Pasta</h4>
    <ol class="directions">
        <li>You can buy pasta or you can make it. I'm going to
            teach how to make pasta for lasagna.</li>
        <li>Sift 200g of flour into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add 1 pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Crack 2 large eggs.</li>
        <li>Add 1 jet of olive oil.</li>
        <li>It stirs very well.</li>
        <li>Finish making the ball with your hand.</li>
        <li>This dough does not need to be kneaded much. just integrate very well all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>We cover it and let it rest for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Before passing the pasta through the machine, stretch it a little with roller.</li>
        <li>If you don't have the machine to make the pasta, roll it out with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>The ideal thickness of the pasta is when it starts to become transparent a little.</li>
        <li>Cut the sheets in size 10x12 cm. I have left 17l sheets.</li>
        <li>In plenty of salted water, cook the pasta. I'm going to cook it in 2 batches 
            so that the sheets do not stick to each other.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>We rinse it with cold water.</li>
        <li>  We put it on a cloth to dry.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="sub-section-title">Bechamel</h4>
    <ol class="directions">
    <li>To make bechamel, melt the butter.
    <li>Add the flour.
    <li>Sauté the flour for 2-3 minutes over medium heat.
    <li>Add the cold milk and turn the heat to high.
    <li>It stirs very well. In cold milk the flour dissolves very well.
    <li>The bechamel must be stirred all the time until it thickens.
    <li>As soon as it breaks to boil we make the medium fire and cook it 2-3 more minutes.
    <li>Remove the bechamel from the heat.
    <li>And we season it. Add 1 pinch of nutmeg.
    <li>Salt.
    <li>A little ground black pepper.
    <li>So that a crust does not form, I cover it with a piece of transparent film.
    <li>Grate the parmesan-oparmigiano.
    <li>Preheat oven to 180°C or 360°F with top and bottom heat.
    <li>Spread the moldeola fountain with the butter. The size of my mold is 24x24x6.5cm
    <li>Cover the bottom with the bechamel.
    <li>Place a layer of pasta on top.
    <li>On top of pasta goes the meat ragúosalsa.
    <li>Drizzle the ragu with a little bechamel.
    <li>Sprinkle with Parmigiano.
    <li>Again we put pasta, ragu, bechamel, parmesan and so on until we fill the mold.
        generously with cheese.
    <li>We bake the lasagna for 45 minutes, the last 5 minutes with a grid of 250°C.
    <li>Before serving, let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
